I have been a big basketball fan since my primary school, and consequently NBA has become an important part of my life. I used to tell people, if they asked, that my dream was to become a NBA player, I mean, seriously. Well today it kind of comes true, I am a NBA DATA player right now.

One of the greatest pleasure NBA gives to me is its Allstar Weekend. I can still remember the joys and the sorrows (if you remember Allstar 2003, Michael Jordanâ€™s last NBA Allstar game) that have come along with this event. What has been different in this year with the others is that, as a duteous data player, I was starting to think what else people would feel about the Allstar game.
